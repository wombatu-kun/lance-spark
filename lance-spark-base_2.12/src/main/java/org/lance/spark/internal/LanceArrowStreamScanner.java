/**
 * Exports a Lance fragment scan as an Arrow C Data Interface stream ({@link ArrowArrayStream}) for
 * native consumers such as Apache Gluten / Velox.
 *
 * <p>Only the {@link ArrowArrayStream} C-struct address ({@link LanceArrowStream#streamAddress()})
 * crosses the JVM/native boundary, so the consumer's Arrow build and classloader do not need to
 * match lance-spark's. Scan planning — column projection, filter pushdown, limit/offset, batch size
 * — is delegated to {@link LanceFragmentScanner}.
 *
 * <p>{@link #export} rejects a partition with a pushed aggregation (e.g. {@code COUNT(*)}): its
 * Spark output is the aggregate result produced by a dedicated reader ({@link
 * org.lance.spark.read.LanceCountStarPartitionReader}), not the data rows this fragment scan
 * returns. Filter, limit, offset, and top-N ordering, by contrast, are pushed faithfully into the
 * native scan, so they are exportable.
 *
 * <p>The export is zero-copy: it cannot re-project or reorder columns the way the Spark columnar
 * reader does on the JVM after import. So {@link #export} verifies that the schema the native scan
 * actually produces equals the declared partition schema (field names, in order) and rejects the
 * partition otherwise. This covers columns the columnar reader reconciles after import — the
 * synthesized {@code _fragid}, the {@code _score} a full-text query auto-projects, the {@code
 * _rowaddr} added for blob columns, the {@code _rowid} an empty projection surfaces, and reordered
 * row-version columns — none of which the raw stream can reproduce.
 *
 * <p>The Lance native core writes batches into the caller-owned stream on demand as the consumer
 * pulls them, so no Arrow data is materialized on the JVM heap on this path.
