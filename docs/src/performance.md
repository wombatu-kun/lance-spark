# Performance Tuning

This guide covers performance tuning for Lance Spark operations in large-scale ETL and batch processing scenarios.

## Understanding Lance's Default Optimization

Lance is **optimized by default for random access patterns** - fast point lookups, vector searches, and selective column reads.
These defaults work well for ML/AI workloads where you frequently access individual records or small batches.

For **large-scale batch ETL and scan-heavy OLAP operations** (writing millions of rows, full table scans, bulk exports),
you can tune Lance's environment variables and Spark options to better utilize available resources.

## General Recommendations

For optimal performance with Lance, we recommend:

1. **Use fixed-size lists for vector columns** - Store embedding vectors as `ARRAY<FLOAT>` with a fixed dimension. This enables efficient SIMD operations and better compression. See [Vector Columns](operations/ddl/create-table.md#vector-columns).

2. **Use blob encoding for multimodal data** - Store large binary data (images, audio, video) using Lance's unique blob encoding to enable efficient access. See [Blob Columns](operations/ddl/create-table.md#blob-columns).

3. **Use large varchar for large text** - When storing very large string values for use cases like full text search, use the large varchar type to avoid out of memory issues. See [Large String Columns](operations/ddl/create-table.md#large-string-columns).

## Write Performance

### Upload Concurrency

Set via environment variable `LANCE_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY` (default: 10).

Controls the number of concurrent multipart upload streams to S3. 
Increasing this to match your CPU core count can improve throughput.

```bash
export LANCE_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY=32
```

### Upload Part Size

Set via environment variable `LANCE_INITIAL_UPLOAD_SIZE` (default: 5MB).

Controls the initial part size for S3 multipart uploads. 
Larger part sizes reduce the number of API calls and can improve throughput for large writes. 
However, larger part sizes use more memory and may increase latency for small writes. 
Use the default for interactive workloads.

!!!note
      Lance automatically increments the multipart upload size by 5MB every 100 uploads,
      so large file writes progressively use increasingly large upload parts.
      There is no configuration for a fixed upload size.

```bash
export LANCE_INITIAL_UPLOAD_SIZE=33554432  # 32MB
```

### Queued Write Buffer (Experimental)

Set via Spark write option `use_queued_write_buffer` (default: false).

Enables a buffered write mode that improves throughput for large batch writes.
When enabled, Lance uses a queue-based buffer instead of the default semaphore-based buffer
that batches data more efficiently before writing to storage,
avoiding small lock waiting operations between Spark producer and Lance writer.

!!!note
      This feature is currently in experimental mode.
      It will be set to true by default after the community considers it mature. 

```python
df.write \
    .format("lance") \
    .option("use_queued_write_buffer", "true") \
    .mode("append") \
    .saveAsTable("my_table")
```

### Max Batch Bytes

Set via Spark write option `max_batch_bytes` (default: 268435456, i.e. 256MB).

Controls the maximum in-memory size of each Arrow batch before it is flushed.
Batches are flushed when either the row count reaches `batch_size` or the allocated memory
reaches `max_batch_bytes`, whichever comes first.

This prevents OOM when writing tables with very large rows — wide schemas, large binary/string
columns, or high-dimensional vector embeddings — where even a modest number of rows can exhaust
memory before the row-count threshold is reached.

Small-row workloads are unaffected because the row-count limit is hit first.

!!!note
      When using the queued write buffer, total in-flight Arrow memory can be roughly
      `queue_depth * max_batch_bytes`. You may need to tune `queue_depth` and `max_batch_bytes`
      together to stay within memory limits.

```python
df.write \
    .format("lance") \
    .option("max_batch_bytes", "134217728") \
    .mode("append") \
    .saveAsTable("my_table")  # 128MB per batch
```

### Max Rows Per File

Set via Spark write option `max_row_per_file` (default: 1,000,000).

Controls the maximum number of rows per Lance fragment file.
There is no specific recommended value, but be aware the default is 1 million rows.
If you store many multimodal data columns (images, audio, embeddings)
without using [Lance blob encoding](operations/dml/dataframe-write.md#writing-blob-data),
or store a lot of long text columns, the file size might become very large.
From Lance's perspective, having very large files does not impact your read performance.
But you may want to reduce this value depending on the limits in your choice of object storage.

```python
df.write \
    .format("lance") \
    .option("max_row_per_file", "500000") \
    .mode("append") \
    .saveAsTable("my_table")
```

### Large Var Types

Set via Spark write option `use_large_var_types` (default: false).

Switches all string and binary columns to use 64-bit offset Arrow vectors
(`LargeVarCharVector` / `LargeVarBinaryVector`) instead of the default 32-bit offset vectors.
This removes the 2GB-per-batch data buffer limit that can cause `OversizedAllocationException`
when writing rows with very large string or binary values.

Use this when your rows contain large values (hundreds of KB or more per row) and you
hit the 2GB overflow error. There is no meaningful performance overhead -- the only
difference is 8 bytes per row for the offset buffer instead of 4.

```python
df.write \
    .format("lance") \
    .option("use_large_var_types", "true") \
    .mode("append") \
    .saveAsTable("my_table")
```

!!!note
    For per-column control at table creation time, see the
    [`arrow.large_var_char` table property](operations/ddl/create-table.md#large-string-columns).

## Read Performance

### I/O Threads

Set via environment variable `LANCE_IO_THREADS` (default: 64).

Controls the number of I/O threads used for parallel reads from storage. 
For large scans, increasing this to match your CPU core count enables more concurrent S3 requests.

```bash
export LANCE_IO_THREADS=128
```

### Custom Read Metrics

Lance Spark reports per-task custom metrics on the Spark UI Scan node, viewable in the SQL tab's
physical plan. These are useful for diagnosing read-path performance — pruning effectiveness, JNI
overhead, and where time is being spent.

Naming conventions:

- Counters use the `num*` prefix.
- Durations use the `*TimeNs` suffix and are displayed in the UI as formatted strings
  (e.g. `1.2 s`, `350 ms`, `47 us`) rather than raw nanoseconds.

| Metric | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `numFragmentsScanned` | counter | Lance fragments actually opened by this task. Compare against the table fragment count to verify pruning is working. |
| `numBatchesLoaded` | counter | Arrow batches returned from the JNI scanner. |
| `numRowsScanned` | counter | Rows read from storage before filter evaluation. Pair with Spark's built-in `numOutputRows` to compute filter selectivity (`numOutputRows / numRowsScanned`). |
| `datasetOpenTimeNs` | duration | Time spent in `Dataset.open(...)` — manifest load, namespace lookup, credential fetch. High values indicate catalog or metadata cache misses. |
| `scannerCreateTimeNs` | duration | Time spent in `fragment.newScan(...)` — scan planning, predicate compilation, index lookup setup. |
| `batchLoadTimeNs` | duration | Wall-clock time inside `loadNextBatch` — JNI crossing, IO, and Arrow IPC deserialization. Divide by `numBatchesLoaded` to get per-batch cost. |

How to read these together:

- **Pushdown verification**: a low `numRowsScanned / numOutputRows` ratio means filters are being
  pushed down effectively. A 1:1 ratio means every row is being scanned and filtered in Spark —
  check whether your predicate is supported for pushdown.
- **Per-batch JNI cost**: `batchLoadTimeNs / numBatchesLoaded` gives the average cost of one batch
  crossing JNI. If this is high relative to total query time, consider increasing
  `LanceSparkReadOptions.batchSize` to amortize JNI overhead over more rows.
- **Catalog overhead**: `datasetOpenTimeNs` accumulates per fragment opened. If many fragments are
  opened per task, this can dominate; metadata cache size and namespace caching matter most here.

!!!note
      Additional metrics covering bytes read, fragments pruned, index lookups, and IO/decode
      time breakdown require new APIs in `lance-jni` and will be added once that surface is
      available upstream.

## Caching

Lance Spark uses a multi-level caching strategy to minimize redundant I/O and improve query performance.

!!!note
    Caches are isolated per Spark catalog. For multi-tenant deployments, configure one Lance catalog per tenant to provide complete cache and credential isolation. If you configure multiple catalogs, total memory usage is multiplied by the number of catalogs. For example, with default settings (6GB index + 1GB metadata) and 3 catalogs, the maximum cache memory is 21GB (3 × 7GB).

### How Caching Works

Lance Spark implements two levels of caching:

1. **Session Cache** - Contains index and metadata caches:

    - **Index Cache**: Caches opened vector indices, fragment reuse indices, and index metadata
    - **Metadata Cache**: Caches manifests, transactions, deletion files, row ID indices, and file metadata

2. **Dataset Cache** - Caches opened datasets by `(catalog, URI, version)` key. Since a dataset at a specific version is immutable, this ensures:

    - Each dataset is opened only once per worker
    - All workers read the same version for snapshot isolation
    - Fragments are pre-loaded and cached per dataset

### Index Cache Size

Set via environment variable `LANCE_INDEX_CACHE_SIZE` (default: 6GB from Lance native).

Controls the size of the index cache in bytes.
The index cache stores vector indices which can be large but provide significant speedup for vector search queries.
Increase this if you frequently query tables with vector indices.

```bash
export LANCE_INDEX_CACHE_SIZE=8589934592  # 8GB
```

### Metadata Cache Size

Set via environment variable `LANCE_METADATA_CACHE_SIZE` (default: 1GB from Lance native).

Controls the size of the metadata cache in bytes.
The metadata cache stores manifests, file metadata, and other dataset metadata.
Each column's metadata can be around 40MB, so increase this if your tables have many columns.

```bash
export LANCE_METADATA_CACHE_SIZE=2147483648  # 2GB
```
